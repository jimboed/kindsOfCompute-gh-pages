# Have a Heading

*************************************************************************************
## 00 Overview
Have an overview. Say what is the objective of the steps you are enumerating, then, enumerate the steps.
They should be a list, and have a 1 to 1 with the steps in the playbook. 
Answer the questions: what is the task to be accomplished, and what will it take to complete the task? 

- 00 overview
- 01 Objective of the Step

## 01 Objective of the Step
This can be a full explanation of the step. While the "quick overview of Step" gives you a quick handle in the overview on ---- ----> 

that side of the page, this section gives you chance to give a more verbose explanation of the step youre trying to explain. 

in general, 


1. use a divider to separate the sections that are steps. 
2. enumerate the steps
3. give an overview title with h2 heading
4. give an explanation if its needed. 
5. give the code to run, indented as code, or "block code fences". That will provide a "copy link".
6. give example output for the code that is run, BUT separated from the input code that produced it. format it as 'console output' or or "block code fences".
7. maybe a screen capture could be used in place of code and console output, if its manual steps. 
    - screencaps should be organized in the assets folder according to the page they are created for, not just a jumble of assets. 

8. video walkthroughs are extremely helpful. 

obviously there will be places where this formatting wont work. we will cross that bridge when we come to it. Im just taking up space here, to see how the formatting works when rendered. it looks like maybe since and h6 heading is actually smaller than plain text, and text in code block fences, you can use it to denote a difference in the commands to run, and the output
###### run:

    python3 this_is_the_code_to_run.py

###### result: 
```console
    this will be the output

    I think it might be helpful to denote that it is "the result of code that has been 
    run" , if you use the block code fence, and also indent within the code fence. 
```
