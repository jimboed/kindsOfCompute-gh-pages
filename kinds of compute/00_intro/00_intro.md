# kinds of compute
:simple-azuredataexplorer:

### kinds topics
- lambda 
- turning 
- nots ands ors(actually, evertyhing is a nand.)
but nands arent the only things that compute.

- cyclic tag systems
- cellular automata (rule 110, game of life)
- pictures (interaction nets)
https://gwern.net/doc/cs/algorithm/2008-changizi.pdf
- tilting 1
- tilting 2 (permtations)
- arrangement (https://chemlambda.github.io)
- mov is turing complete
- rotation 1 (holographic reduced representaitons, interference and phase cancellation )
- rotation 2 (feedback, and resonance)

- randmoness (binary spatter codes, vsa, sdm, hyperdimensional vectors)
- neural (htm, sdm, feedbackAndResonance revisited.)
- one bit turing complete ness: (golem?) (memory)(iota combinator)

- quantum (geometric algebra)
- interaction is computation

```
if a physics system can create a computer, 
that i can then write a program to encode another computaitonal system, 
that encodes and runs a prgram that follows all the same rules as physics, 
and use that simulated physics program to then encode a computer, 
isnt that initial physics system a computational system that gives the ability to run a program that can encode a computer? 

and in that case, arent atoms? 

and in that case, arent ALL interactions? 


```


### secondary topics
- distinguishability
- counterfactuals (science of can and cant)
- these arent the ony ones. there are others undiscovered and unrealised. 
- emergence (computational systems that encode comutational systems)
```
start with a computational system. it may have the possiblity to encode another computatonal system that depends on another kind of compute. 

and that new derived 2nd level computational system can then encode another computational system, and on and on. 

this is  what quantum>atomic>chemical>biological>>neural>social>cosmic>ect.

is doing. 

its not mysterious. its not magic. its computaiton.
